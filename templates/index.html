        <h1>N-gram Models</h1>
        <div id = "content-1">
            <h2>What are N-grams?</h2>
            <p>An n-gram is a sequence of <strong>n</strong> adjacent phonemes, syllables, letters or words in a particular order. N-grams can be classified into many divisions based on their n value.
                For example, if n is 1, we call it a unigram; n = 2, a bigram and so on with the prefixes being describing of their sequences.<br>
                <br>
                Let's take the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." and generate n-grams from it:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unigrams</strong>:  "The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"<br>
                <li><strong>Bigrams</strong>:  "The quick", "quick brown", "brown fox", "fox jumps", "jumps over", "over the", "the lazy", "lazy dog"<br>
                <li><strong>Trigrams</strong>:  "The quick brown", "quick brown fox", "brown fox jumps", "fox jumps over", "jumps over the", "over the lazy", "the lazy dog"<br>
            </ul>
            <p> As you can see, the Bigrams contain more context than the Unigrams and Trigrams contain more context than both. Now we will move on to the N-gram models.<br>
                If you want to learn more about n-grams you can go to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">here</a> and <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf">here</a>.

            <h2>What are N-gram Language Models?</h2>
            <p>An N-gram language model predicts the probability of a given N-gram within any sequence of words in a language (or the ones in its training data). The model predicts the next word by taking the last
               sequences of words in the input and comparing it with the available data to find which word is the most likely to occur next. Some may find this useful as it provides an accurate relationsip between
               words. On the other hand, if we desire uniqueness, we might need to randomize the selection of the words.<br><br>

               You can find more information about this <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf">here</a>.

        <div id = "content-3">
            <h2>How my model works</h2>
            <p> My N-gram model is fairly simple. It doesn't use any of those smoothing techniques nor does it require different functions to create and use different n-grams.<br>
                It basically works by using nested dictionaries where the previous word is the key for the current one. It generates dictionaries for a bigram like this:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>{ "Word1": {
                        <ul>
                            <li> "Word2" : 0.5,
                            <li> "Word9" : 0.5 },
                        </ul>

                    <li> "Word2": {
                        <ul>
                            <li> "Word3" : 0.3333333333333,
                            <li> "Word18" : 0.3333333333333,
                            <li> "Word29" : 0.3333333333333 }}
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                The numbers at the last of the dictionary tell the probability of that combination of words happening.<br>
                The N-gram model then uses this to predict more words. You can go to the <a href = "https://github.com/GlassyBridge/Ngram">github repository</a> to see how its done.
